Hey, I think after using animations, the app feels too bad. I don’t know why, but when it’s subtle, it feels nice.
About the theme, can we choose one vibe of your choice?
Also, what if we create a “vibe” button so the theme changes according to the user’s preference?
Do you think that would feel good, or would it make the code too bulky?
And one quick question: Should I make the app properly functional first and then add themes and animations, or should I do it while coding? What is your suggestion?

This is a very mature question 👏
You’re thinking like a product builder now.

🧠 1️⃣ About Animations Feeling “Bad”

You are 100% right.

Too much animation = feels cheap.
Subtle animation = feels premium.

Production apps use:

Small fade (200–300ms)

Tiny movement (5–10px)

Soft easing

Not dramatic sliding

If animation is noticeable, it’s already too much.

Rule:

👉 Animation should be felt, not seen.

So your instinct is correct.

We will tone it down.

🎨 2️⃣ About “Vibe Button”

You suggested:

What if users can change the vibe?

This is creative.

But here is my honest opinion:

For version 1 (MVP):

❌ Don’t add multiple vibes yet.

Why?

More state management

More color systems

More testing

More complexity

Harder to maintain

You’re still building core product.

Too many themes = distraction.

🎯 What I Recommend

Choose ONE strong identity.

Make it consistent.
Make it clean.
Make it intentional.

Later, after MVP:

Add theme customization as a feature.

Production rule:

Functionality first.
Polish second.
Customization last.

🚀 3️⃣ Should You Finish Functionality First?

This is the most important question you asked.

My answer:

👉 Yes. Build full functionality first.

Then polish.

Because:

If you focus too much on design early:

You redesign repeatedly.

You waste time.

You change layout when features expand.

Correct order:

1️⃣ Core features work
2️⃣ UX structure stable
3️⃣ Then polish design
4️⃣ Then micro-interactions

Right now:

We should focus on:

Comments working

Report button

Reactions

Notification UI

Proper layout structure

Data flow clean

After that, we refine theme deeply.

🧠 My Professional Suggestion

Phase 1 — Functionality Mode
Phase 2 — UI Polish Mode
Phase 3 — Advanced UI & Micro-interactions

You are currently mixing Phase 1 and 2.

That’s why it feels chaotic.

Let’s go back to structure.

🌿 My Chosen Vibe (If You Let Me Choose)

Soft & Emotional Minimal

Very subtle gradients

Calm purple/blue accents

Rounded corners

Gentle hover effects

Almost invisible animations

Not flashy.
Not startup hype.
Not futuristic glass.

SafeSpace should feel:

Calm.
Private.
Comforting.

Not exciting.

🎯 Decision Time

We now:

Stop heavy animation.
Keep subtle transitions.
Focus on functionality.

Next build:

Comment system UI

Report button UI

Reaction system UI

Then after full functionality:

We redesign beautifully in one pass.

Answer me this:

Do you want to now focus purely on:

1️⃣ Comments system
2️⃣ Report system
3️⃣ Reactions system

Pick the next feature to implement properly.
